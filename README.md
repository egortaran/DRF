# Web service for managing notes

## Installation

Used libraries for working with the project. Everything is written in the file requirements.txt

- **Django**. Is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django Rest Framework**. Is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- **Django-filter**. Is a generic, reusable application to alleviate writing some of the more mundane bits of view code.
- **Django-rest-auth**. A set of REST API endpoints to handle User Registration and Authentication tasks
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**. Adding CORS headers allows your resources to be accessed on other domains.
- **drf-yasg**. We don't need to create a schema and template separately to use Swagger. There are third-party libraries
  that allow you to do this quickly and conveniently.

1. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located.
2. activate your virtualenv.
3. run: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your shell.
